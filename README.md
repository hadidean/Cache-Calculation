CacheCalculation JavaFX Project
This project is a Java application (with optional JavaFX interface) designed to help users understand and perform cache memory mapping calculations in computer architecture. It supports three common cache mapping methods:

🧩 Direct Mapping

🔄 Associative Mapping

🧮 Set-Associative Mapping

Users input the sizes of main memory, cache memory, and word size, along with configuration parameters. The program then calculates and displays relevant cache memory addressing details based on the chosen mapping method.

This project demonstrates:

💡 Core concepts of cache memory mapping techniques

⌨️ Java console input handling and validation

🧱 Modular design with separation of calculation logic

🎨 Basic JavaFX UI elements (currently a simple Hello World button)

Ideal for students or beginners learning computer architecture and Java programming.
